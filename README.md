I use obsidian mostly as a todo + daily note taking app.

This is the barebones of my obsidian setup without the private notes.

## How do I use this?

Replace your obsidian vault's `.obsidian` file with mine, or alternatively, cherry-pick the things you'd like. Additionally copy over the `Templates` folder if you wanted to take advantage of the automated daily template and 1-2-1 note template.

## Required things to make this setup work
### Tasks
- **Tasks**: [obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin) ([docs](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction))
- **Templater**: [obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=templater-obsidian) ([docs](https://silentvoid13.github.io/Templater/introduction.html))

If you'll also like to have some custom styling to tasks, like `in-progress` state having unique styling, while keeping the base obsidian theme - install the following theme: https://github.com/david-gomes5/Gomes
